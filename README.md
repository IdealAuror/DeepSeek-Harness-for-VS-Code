Use [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) directly in VS Code, alongside ChatGPT / Copilot: the built-in `@dsh` chat participant, secondary sidebar / standalone chat windows, workspaces / jobs / trajectory / settings panels, turn-level Git rollback, and a **multi-language UI** (简体中文 / 繁體中文 / English / 日本語 / 한국어 / Deutsch / Français / Español / Português / ไทย / Bahasa Indonesia / Türkçe / Русский / العربية — follows the VS Code display language or switch manually).

## Features

- **Built-in chat participant `@dsh`**: type `@` in the native Chat panel (Ctrl+Alt+I); streamed replies with tool calls and approval buttons; slash commands `/new`, `/session <ID>`, `/preset <name>`.
- **Secondary sidebar tab**: container appears in the Secondary Side Bar on VS Code ≥ 1.106 (falls back to the Activity Bar on older versions).
- **Standalone chat window**: `DSH: Open Standalone Chat Window`.
- **Modern chat UI**: large rounded input box, pill toolbar (thinking depth / model / preset / permission), and a **context meter ring** at the top-right of the input box, right of the preset pill (web parity: click for "context used", the ~used / window reading, and the system-prompt / tool-definition / conversation breakdown with colour-coded bar segments and per-category token counts). Below the input box sit two **session statistic pills** (web parity): `4 turns 285 steps · 267 tok/s` (click for session statistics — LLM time, tool time, average TTFT, output TPS) and `71M tok · 99.6% cache hit` (click for token usage — exact total, cache hit, uncached input, cache read/write, output).
- **Per-message actions** (minimal line icons): copy (double-rectangle icon) / branch (forked line icon; menu: counter-clockwise arrow "Rewind here" · forked icon "Branch from here" · up-left fold "Branch and rewind earlier" · up-left arrow "Back to main") / thumbs up/down (line icons; native `messageFeedback` with click-again-to-revoke, `/feedback` command fallback for older sessions) / message header shows model · thinking time · per-step tokens.
- **Turn footer stats** (web parity): a `Usage 25.8K tok` pill (click for provider/model, cache hit rate, uncached input, cache read/write, output with reasoning share), a `Ran for 5m 57s` pill (click for total turn time, output TPS, time to first token), and the local clock of the closing message at the row's right end (`HH:mm`, `M/D HH:mm` for earlier days, `Y-M-D HH:mm` for other years). While the session is running, an earlier turn's action row and stats stay hidden and fade in on hover (only the settled latest turn shows them) — the web's `data-actions-reveal` behaviour.
- **Step timeline** (web ToolRow / ThinkRow parity): thinking and tool calls render as one-line process rows on a left rail — `思考 • <first line>` (expanded while it streams, collapsed once thinking ends, manual toggles preserved) and `Read/Write/Pwsh/Grep • <human summary>` with a status dot, a running sweep animation, and the full arguments/result (plus image results) behind a click; rows appear live as each event arrives, each run of rows ends with a web-style summary line (`1 command · read 1 file · searched 2 times`) that folds or unfolds that run when clicked, and the activity line above the composer names the running action (tool title + summary) rather than a generic label. Long JSON no longer floods the row.
- **Deliverable file cards** (web `present` parity): files the model delivers appear as cards at the turn tail — file name + description, an **Open** button (opens the file, or the HEAD→worktree diff for tracked files) and a **⋯ menu** with "Open with default app" and "Reveal in File Explorer".
- **Turn-level Git rollback** (↩ button on each assistant turn + branch-menu entries): the DSH server-side plugin `dsh-git-rollback` snapshots the workspace's git state (tracked + untracked files) at every turn start into hidden refs (`refs/dsh/checkpoints/<sid>`, zero pollution of your branch history) and records them under `.dsh/rollback`; the button restores the workspace to the state before that turn. Commands `/rollback [N]`, `/redo`, `/checkpoints` work in both the web command panel and the VS Code chat (rollback is non-destructive: the pre-rollback state is saved first, `/redo` restores it, ignored files are never touched). Each message's ⋯/branch menu also offers **"Undo this turn's file changes"** (preview-and-confirm review dialog, reverses only the files that turn changed — your own commits and HEAD stay untouched), **"View checkpoints"**, and "Undo this turn's changes and branch from here". The web chat gets the same Copilot-style turn dividers and a floating restore dialog out of the box (plugin web half, served via the DSH client-modules pipeline).

![Message actions with undo / checkpoints / branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEXTINDIE/DeepSeek-Harness-for-VS-Code/main/media/git-2.jpg)
- **Collapsible reasoning** (hidden by default) and per-turn tool summary ("Called N tools this turn").
- **Deliverables box**: files produced each turn listed at the end of the conversation, click to open.
- **Session management**: ⋯ menu with fork / rename (pre-filled title) / archive.
- **Goals**: progress card + 🎯 chip with edit / complete / clear.
- **Timed (asynchronous) questions** (DSH 0.2.0+): a question that carries a wait budget shows a live countdown pill on its card; when the wait expires the agent carries on and the card stays answerable ("wait ended · you can still answer later"), with the late reply delivered as a follow-up message in the same session.
- **To-do panel** (web TodoPanel parity, docked above the composer): checklist icon + "To-dos" + a per-status summary that only lists non-zero counts ("2 completed · 1 in progress · 1 pending"), collapsible list with the web's three status glyphs (green check ring / spinning gradient ring / dashed ring).
- **Plan mode**: 📝 chip appears after `/plan`, click to exit.
- **Attachments**: auto-attach the active editor file (follows editor switches) + add file/folder (separate pickers); context is injected into the model but displayed collapsed.
- **Subagents**: status chips with recent-reply preview.
- **Skills**: available skills listed in the `/` menu (official skill.list).
- **.claude / .codex / GitHub Copilot directories**: CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md auto-loaded by the DSH core; `.claude/commands`, `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills` (SKILL.md), `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions`, `.github/agents` and `.github/prompts` are listed in the `/` menu and insertable.
- **Permissions**: read-only / workspace-write / full-access switch (official `/permission` command).
- **Cross-project sessions**: per-folder @dsh sessions; multi-root follows the active editor; `dsh.participantSessionMode: global` to share one session.
- **Workspace browser** (📁 button, web Workspaces parity): sessions grouped by workspace; add / rename / delete / reorder workspaces; per-group session ordering and archive; session content search (instant title matches + server content search with local fallback when the index is disabled); rows show waiting-for-approval / plan-review / question / running states.
- **Background jobs panel** (⚙️ button): bash / pwsh / subagent jobs for the current session with status, timings, and detail, live from session/jobs frames.
- **Automation tasks panel** (⏰ button, host-side `schedule/*`, DSH 0.1.7+): every retained reminder with its rule text, next scheduled time and countdown, enabled / ended status, search and status filter; open a task for its instruction, frequency, time zone, linked session (jump straight to it), last delivery and its **delivery records** (newest-first with paging) and delete it after an inline confirmation. The catalog refreshes itself from the host's `schedule/changed` event; when the host has the schedule plugin disabled (the 0.1.7 default) the panel says so instead of erroring.
- **Automation tasks panel** (⏰ button, host-side `schedule/*`, DSH 0.1.7+): every retained reminder with its rule text, next scheduled time and countdown, enabled / ended status, search and status filter; open a task for its instruction, frequency, time zone, linked session (jump straight to it), last delivery and its **delivery records** (newest-first with paging) and delete it after an inline confirmation. The catalog refreshes itself from the host's `schedule/changed` event; when the host has the schedule plugin disabled (the 0.1.7 default) the panel says so instead of erroring.
- **Trajectory view** (🧭 button, web Trajectory parity): turn-aware event ledger (seq · time · type · summary · token usage), click to expand the full event JSON, type filter. The header toolbar is all line icons (workspace / background jobs / automation tasks / trajectory / settings / subagent catalog) drawn at 15px; the Cordis plugin button keeps its 🧩 emoji, and the Activity Bar / Secondary Side Bar container and the chat view use a line-robot mark (media/robot.svg, masked to the theme icon colour by VS Code) in the theme's icon colour.
- **Settings panel** (⚙️ button, web Settings parity): general settings (schema-driven forms for every namespace, restart badges, per-namespace reset), models & providers (provider route directory + model catalog + endpoint model discovery), credential management (API key set/clear), agent preset authoring on hosts that still expose it — DSH 0.1.7 removed the preset authoring endpoints, so the copy / open-directory / delete buttons only appear when `settings/canOpenAgentPresetDirectory` reports support and presets are otherwise read-only composition text.

![Settings panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEXTINDIE/DeepSeek-Harness-for-VS-Code/main/media/setting.jpg)

- **Subagent conversations**: click a subagent chip to open its transcript; continuable children accept prompts (subagent.prompt) and interrupts (subagent.interrupt).
- **Image attachments**: 🖼️ add images (official image content-block channel), in both sending and history playback.
- **Queued-message actions**: queued messages can be edited / removed / steered (official session.updateQueue).
- **Goal creation**: the 🎯 chip creates a goal when none exists (goal.create with objective and round cap).
- **One-click commit messages**: the ✨ button in the Source Control title bar (`DSH: Generate Commit Message`) reads the staged/unstaged git diff and generates a Conventional Commits-style message in a disposable session (archived immediately, never shown in the session list) with a lightweight model (default: the `flash` keyword matched against the DSH model catalog + low effort; configurable via `dsh.commitModel` / `dsh.commitReasoningEffort`), writing the result into the SCM input box and auto-cancelling on timeout or when the model requests extra interaction. The model switch is temporary — your default model and thinking depth are captured first and restored when generation ends, and the throwaway session is archived only after the answer arrives (DSH 0.1.7 blocks turns on archived sessions).
- **i18n**: Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / Japanese / Korean / German / French / Spanish / Portuguese / Thai / Indonesian / Turkish / Russian / Arabic — follows the VS Code display language, or switch in place via `dsh.language` / the 🌐 section of the settings panel.

## Install

```bash
cd <this folder>
npm install
npm run package          # outputs Releases/dsh-vscode-<version>.vsix
```

VS Code → Extensions → `…` → Install from VSIX → pick the file in `Releases\` → reload.

Prerequisites: VS Code ≥ 1.90 (built-in chat ≥ 1.95; secondary sidebar container ≥ 1.106); DSH CLI or npx fallback; model credentials configured (same as `dsh web`).

## Usage highlights

- The send shortcut is configurable (`dsh.sendKey`): Enter (default), Ctrl+Enter or Shift+Enter sends, the other combination inserts a newline. Previously: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline; while running the send button (paper-plane line icon) becomes stop (square line icon), typing turns it back into send (queued send).
- **↑ / ↓ recall your previous inputs** (like a shell, feature request issue #20): press ↑ with the caret at the start of the first line (or in a one-line input) to walk back through everything you have sent, ↓ to walk forward, and ↓ past the newest entry restores whatever you were typing before you started browsing (Esc does the same). Editing a recalled entry keeps your edit instead of overwriting it, arrow keys still move the caret inside multi-line text, and the history survives hiding or reloading the view.
- `/` button (bottom-left): command menu (plan / compact / goal / feedback / permission / skills / .claude). Most entries insert the command into the input (press Enter to run); **Compact context** runs `/compact` straight away and the conversation shows a live compaction row — a sweep while compacting, then "Compacted N history items (~T tokens)" with the summary expandable, and the compacted range collapses into that row (the same row appears for automatic compaction).
- `+` button next to it: add file / add folder; the blue chip is the auto-attached active file.
- Message actions: click the forked-line icon to open the branch/rewind menu — counter-clockwise arrow "Rewind here", forked icon "Branch from here", up-left fold "Branch and rewind earlier", plus "Undo this turn's file changes" / "View checkpoints" when the git-rollback plugin is active; branch sessions also show the up-left arrow "Back to main". The counter-clockwise arrow on each assistant turn (when the DSH server-side plugin is active) restores the workspace to the state before that turn.
- Session ⋯ menu: fork / rename / archive; preset pill at the top-right (new sessions only); thinking / model pills at the bottom-right.
- Source Control title bar: the ✨ button generates a Conventional Commits message from the current diff and fills the SCM input box (a picker appears when several repositories are open).
- Context menus: selection → `DSH: Send Selection to @dsh`; file → `DSH: Ask @dsh About This File`.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsh.url` | `http://127.0.0.1:3080` | DSH web server URL |
| `dsh.autoStart` | `true` | On VS Code startup, start `dsh web` if the server is not running |
| `dsh.command` | `dsh` | Start command; falls back to npx |
| `dsh.autoStartTimeoutSec` | `60` | Auto-start timeout (seconds) |
| `dsh.participantSessionMode` | `per-workspace` | @dsh session scope: per-project / global |
| `dsh.openPanelOnStartup` | `false` | Open the standalone window on startup |
| `dsh.defaultReasoningEffort` | `""` | Default thinking depth for new sessions (off/high/max, model-dependent) |
| `dsh.commitModel` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Model used to generate commit messages (resolved from the DSH model catalog; falls back to the session's current model) |
| `dsh.commitReasoningEffort` | `low` | Reasoning effort for commit messages (`low` = no thinking on DeepSeek models, fastest) |
| `dsh.language` | `auto` | UI language: auto / zh-cn / zh-tw / en / ja / ko / de / fr / es / pt / th / id / tr / ru / ar |
| `dsh.installRollbackPlugin` | `true` | Auto-install the turn-level Git rollback server plugin into the DSH web profile (enables `/rollback`, `/redo`, `/checkpoints`) |

## Turn-level Git rollback setup

- **Automatic (default)**: the extension ships the `dsh-git-rollback` server plugin (host + web client halves) and installs it into your DSH web profile (`~/.dsh/profiles/web`) on activation (idempotent, version-tracked). If your DSH server was already running, the extension offers a one-click restart when it detects the plugin is not loaded yet. The web client half is picked up automatically by the DSH client-modules pipeline on the next server start — no manual setup.
- **Manual (web GUI users / other profiles)**: from the terminal, `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-git-rollback` (published on npm), then restart `dsh web`.
- Requirements: a Git repository as the session workspace; snapshots are taken at every turn start (turn/start) and survive server restarts via `.dsh/rollback` records + hidden refs (`refs/dsh/checkpoints/<sessionId>`). Disable the auto-install with `dsh.installRollbackPlugin: false`.

## Troubleshooting

- **"This session is already in use" / `session/writer-held`**: a DSH session can only be written by one instance at a time. Quit the other instance that has it attached (the desktop app, another `dsh web`, or a second VS Code window driving the same server), or simply switch to another session in VS Code — then the notice bar above the composer disappears and model switching, renaming and sending work again.

- Nothing appears → reload the window; run `DSH: Show Diagnostics`; check the extension runtime state for validation errors.
- "No registered data provider" → run `DSH: Repair Chat View (Reset View Locations)` or `Restart Extension Host`.
- Service worker error in the webview → VS Code 1.100.x platform bug: update VS Code or clear `%APPDATA%\Code\Service Worker\CacheStorage`.
- "agent preset is fixed" → started sessions cannot switch presets; the preset pill only shows for new sessions.
- Not connected → run `DSH: Start Server`; check `dsh.url`.
- Server version: this build targets **DSH 0.1.5-rc.1** and negotiates the changed attachment parameter names, so a 0.1.2-rc.1 server keeps working (commands, subagent prompts, streaming); upgrading the server to 0.1.5 additionally brings live streaming frames, V3 session logs, and the context breakdown projection.
- Server does not auto-start → the extension retries every 15 s and connects as soon as the server is up; see the `[server]` log in the "DeepSeek Harness" output channel. If the error mentions `0xC0000142`/`EPERM`, VS Code was launched from a DSH session or a restricted terminal (child process creation blocked) — launch VS Code normally, or set that session's permission to `danger-full-access`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run package     # → Releases/
```

- Host: `src/extension.ts`, `src/dsh/*` (API client, server manager, session store, chat participant, project-session mapping, commit message generation).
- UI: `src/webview/{channel,panel,window,ui}.ts` + `media/chat.css`; icon `media/icon.png`.
- i18n: `package.nls.json` + `package.nls.zh-cn/zh-tw/ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/th/id/tr/ar.json`, `l10n/bundle.l10n.json` + `bundle.l10n.zh-cn/zh-tw/ja/ko/de/fr/es/pt/th/id/tr/ar.json`, the `EN_TEXT` dictionary in `ui.ts` + `src/webview/texts/*.json`.
- Server plugins: source lives under `plugins/<name>/` (all new DSH server plugins go there); `npm run build` compiles them and syncs the bundle into `resources/<name>/` via `tools/sync-plugins.mjs` for packaging into the vsix. Unit tests: `cd plugins/<name> && npm test`.

- **一键生成提交信息**:源代码管理(SCM)视图标题栏 ✨ 按钮(`DSH: 生成提交信息`),读取 git 暂存/未暂存 diff,在一次性会话(生成期间隐藏、结束后归档,不占用会话列表)中用轻量模型按 Conventional Commits 风格生成提交信息并写入 SCM 输入框;模型与思考深度可配置(`dsh.commitModel` 为关键字,默认 `flash`,按目录匹配 / `dsh.commitReasoningEffort`),超时或模型请求额外交互时自动取消。模型切换是临时的——先记录你的默认模型与思考深度,生成结束即恢复;一次性会话在拿到结果之后才归档(DSH 0.1.7 对已归档会话会直接 block 回合)。
- **多语言**:扩展与聊天界面支持简体中文 / 繁體中文 / English / 日本語 / 한국어 / Deutsch / Français / Español / Português / ไทย / Bahasa Indonesia / Türkçe / Русский / العربية——跟随 VS Code 显示语言,或通过设置 `dsh.language` / 设置面板 🌐 就地切换。

## 安装

### 方式一:安装 .vsix(推荐)

```bash
cd <本目录>
npm install
npm run package          # 生成 Releases/dsh-vscode-<版本>.vsix
```

VS Code 中:扩展 → `…` → 从 VSIX 安装 → 选择 `Releases\` 下的 .vsix → 重载窗口。

### 方式二:开发模式(F5)

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```

用 VS Code 打开本目录,按 F5 启动扩展开发宿主。

### 前置条件

- VS Code ≥ 1.90;内置聊天 `@dsh` 需要 ≥ 1.95;辅助侧栏容器需要 ≥ 1.106(旧版自动回退活动栏)。
- DSH CLI(`dsh`),或允许扩展用 `npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest` 自动启动服务器。
- DSH 已配置模型凭证(与 `dsh web` 一致)。

## 使用

| 入口 | 说明 |
| --- | --- |
| 内置 Chat `@dsh` | 输入 `@` 选 dsh;`DSH: 打开内置聊天 (@dsh)` 或状态栏 DSH 图标可自动填入 |
| 辅助侧栏 tab | 视图 → 外观 → Secondary Side Bar(Ctrl+Alt+B) |
| 独立窗口 | `DSH: 打开独立聊天窗口` |
| SCM 提交按钮 | 源代码管理视图标题栏的 ✨ 按钮(`DSH: 生成提交信息`),多仓库时弹出选择 |

- 发送快捷键可在设置里选择(`dsh.sendKey`):Enter(默认)/ Ctrl+Enter / Shift+Enter 发送,另一组合键换行。原行为:`Enter` 发送,`Shift+Enter` 换行;运行中发送按钮(纸飞机线条图标)变为停止(方块线条图标),输入文字变回发送(消息排队)。
- **`↑` / `↓` 调回之前发送过的输入**(与终端一致,需求来自 issue #20):光标在首行行首(或单行输入)时按 `↑` 逐条回溯历史输入,`↓` 前进;越过最新一条会恢复进入历史前正在编辑的草稿(`Esc` 同效)。调回后手动编辑的内容不会被覆盖;多行文本中方向键仍只移动光标;历史在视图隐藏 / 重载后仍保留。
- 左下角 `/` 按钮:命令菜单(计划模式 / 压缩上下文 / 设置目标 / 记录反馈 / 切换权限 / 技能 / .claude 命令与技能)。多数项插入命令到输入框(回车执行);**压缩上下文**点击即执行 `/compact`,对话内实时显示压缩行 —— 压缩中扫光,完成后显示「已压缩 N 条历史记录(约 T tokens)」且摘要可展开,被压缩的区间折叠进该行(自动压缩同样单列一行)。
- 左上角 `+` 按钮:添加文件 / 添加文件夹(二选一);附件行蓝色芯片为自动附加的激活文件(× 移除)。
- 消息操作条:点击分叉线条图标打开分支/回退菜单 —— 逆时针箭头"回退到此处"(去掉本条及之后)、分叉图标"从此处新建分支"(保留到此)、左上折线"分支并回退到更早位置",以及 git-rollback 插件激活时的"撤销本回合改动 / 查看检查点";分叉会话另有左上箭头"回到主线"。
- 会话 ⋯ 菜单:分叉 / 重命名 / 归档;右上角"预设"胶囊(仅新会话显示);右下角"思考 / 模型"胶囊。
- 模式芯片:📝 计划模式(点击退出)、🎯 目标模式(点击管理目标)。
- 右键菜单:编辑器选中代码 → `DSH: 发送选中代码到 @dsh`;文件右键 → `DSH: 向 @dsh 询问此文件`。

## 配置

| 配置项 | 默认值 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsh.url` | `http://127.0.0.1:3080` | DSH Web 服务器地址(修改后需重载) |
| `dsh.autoStart` | `true` | VS Code 启动时若服务器未运行则自动启动 `dsh web` |
| `dsh.command` | `dsh` | 启动命令;找不到时回退 npx |
| `dsh.autoStartTimeoutSec` | `60` | 自动启动最长等待秒数 |
| `dsh.participantSessionMode` | `per-workspace` | @dsh 会话范围:每项目 / 全局 |
| `dsh.openPanelOnStartup` | `false` | 启动时自动打开独立聊天窗口 |
| `dsh.defaultReasoningEffort` | `""` | 新会话默认思考深度(off/high/max 等,取决于模型) |
| `dsh.commitModel` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | 生成提交信息所用的模型(从 DSH 模型目录解析,找不到时回退当前模型) |
| `dsh.commitReasoningEffort` | `low` | 生成提交信息时的思考深度(DeepSeek 模型上 low 表示不开思考,最快) |
| `dsh.language` | `auto` | 界面语言:auto / zh-cn / zh-tw / en / ja / ko / de / fr / es / pt / th / id / tr / ru / ar |
| `dsh.installRollbackPlugin` | `true` | 自动把回合级 Git 回退服务端插件安装到 DSH web profile(启用 `/rollback`、`/redo`、`/checkpoints`) |

## 回合级 Git 回退的安装

- **自动(默认)**:扩展随包携带 `dsh-git-rollback` 服务端插件(host + 网页端 client 两半),激活时幂等安装到你的 DSH web profile(`~/.dsh/profiles/web`,带版本标记增量更新)。若 DSH 服务器已在运行,扩展检测到插件未加载时会提示一键重启(仅限本扩展启动的服务器)。网页端 client 半区在下次服务器启动时由 DSH client-modules 管线自动发现,无需手动配置。
- **手动(web 界面用户 / 其他 profile)**:终端执行 `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-git-rollback`(已发布到 npm),然后重启 `dsh web`。
- 前提:会话工作区是 git 仓库;每个回合开始(turn/start)自动快照,重启服务器后检查点依然可用(记录在 `.dsh/rollback` + 隐藏引用 `refs/dsh/checkpoints/<会话ID>`)。可设置 `dsh.installRollbackPlugin: false` 关闭自动安装。

## 故障排查

- **「当前会话已被占用」/ `session/writer-held`**:DSH 的会话同一时刻只允许一个实例写入。请退出已挂载该会话的另一端(桌面端、另一个 `dsh web`,或驱动同一服务器的另一个 VS Code 窗口),或在 VS Code 里直接换一个会话 —— 输入框上方的占用提示条会自动消失,切模型 / 重命名 / 发送即可恢复。

- **扩展没出现**:确认已重载窗口;扩展面板查看运行时状态有无校验错误;命令面板执行 `DSH: 显示诊断信息`。
- **视图占位"没有已注册数据提供程序"**:执行 `DSH: 修复聊天视图(重置视图位置)`,或命令面板 `Restart Extension Host`。
- **Webview 报 Service Worker 错误**:VS Code 1.100.x 平台缺陷,升级 VS Code 或清空 `%APPDATA%\Code\Service Worker\CacheStorage`。
- **"agent preset is fixed"**:已开始的会话不可切换预设,预设胶囊只在新会话显示。
- **未连接**:执行 `DSH: 启动服务器`;检查 `dsh.url` 端口。
- **服务器版本**:本版本面向 **DSH 0.1.5-rc.1**,并会对改名的附件参数做协商,因此 0.1.2-rc.1 服务器同样可用(命令、子代理消息、流式输出);服务器升级到 0.1.5 后另有逐 token 流式帧、V3 会话日志与上下文构成投影。
- **启动时无法自动启动服务器**:扩展会在 VS Code 启动时自动启动 `dsh web`(失败后每 15 秒重探,服务器上线即自动连接);具体失败原因见输出通道 "DeepSeek Harness" 的 `[server]` 日志。若报错含 `0xC0000142`/`EPERM`,说明 VS Code 是从 DSH 会话或受限终端启动的(子进程创建被拦截)——改用普通方式启动 VS Code,或把该会话权限调为 `danger-full-access`。
